# COSBAS-Server

The Computer Science Biometric Access System's Server Code.

## Notes to the team
* Please look into using git [commit keywords](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/).
* Please document all code *immediately* using JavaDoc
* All http routes must be documented, maybe on the wiki somewhere? This gets really confusing to keep track of after a while...
* Please use *pull requests* to merge into main -- do **not** merge directly. This means someone else can review your code and we have a better history.
